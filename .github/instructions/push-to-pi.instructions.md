After completing the assigned task(s) and **BEFORE** returning control to the User, you MUST do **ALL** of the following:

1. Bump the version number in `package.json` according to semantic versioning rules (patch, minor, major) based on the nature of the changes made.
2. Commit all changes to git. 
3. Make sure that the updated and version-bumped code is installed on the Homebridge instance on my Raspberry Pi 5 device.
